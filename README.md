# Task-1-Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocess
1: Step-by-Step Report
The following steps were taken to clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, using Excel:
Column Headers: All column headers were standardized to a clean, uniform format (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, removing underscores).
Missing Values: Missing values were addressed by filtering the header rows for blanks. For columns such as Director, cast, and country, all identified blank cells were populated with the value UNKNOWN.
Duplicates: Duplicate records were removed using Excel's built-in REMOVE DUPLICATES feature.
Date Format: The date column was converted to the standard format DD-MM-YYYY.
Text Standardization: Textual data, specifically in the country column, was standardized; for instance, "United States" was uniformly converted to USA , Listed_in was converted to Listed_Type
